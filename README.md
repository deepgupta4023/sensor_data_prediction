# sensor_data_prediction
Using Data ETL and Machine Learning on real life data from sensors of a Centrifugal Pump

To test your file on the model import file 'prediction.py
use the function 'predict(test_file,model_path)
Here
test_file:  json test file 
model_path: path to our Machine Learning Model. 
            Suppose the model is in 'C:\Documents' provide path as 'C:\\Documents\\Model'
            Provide the model name i,e 'model'  if it is in the same directory.
