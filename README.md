# sensor_data_prediction
Using Data ETL and Machine Learning on real life data from sensors of a Centrifugal Pump

To test your file on the model import file 'prediction.py'
use the function 'predict(test_file,model_path)
Here test_file:  json test file 
model_path: path to our Machine Learning Model. Leave it to default if the 'model' is in the same directory.
            Suppose the model is in 'C:\Documents' provide path as 'C:\\Documents\\Model'
